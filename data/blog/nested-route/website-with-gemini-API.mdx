### Introduction
Gemini is a new internet protocol designed for the distributed web. It's lightweight, secure, and privacy-focused. In this tutorial, we'll walk through building your first website using the Gemini API. By the end, you'll have a simple Gemini-powered website up and running.

### Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following:
- Basic knowledge of HTML and web development.
- Python installed on your system.
- A text editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text).

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment
First, let's set up a project directory for our website.

1. Create a new directory for your project:
   ```bash
   mkdir my_gemini_website
   cd my_gemini_website
   ```

2. Create a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

### Step 2: Install the Gemini Server Library
Next, let's install the `txgemini` library, a Python implementation of the Gemini protocol.

```bash
pip install txgemini
```

### Step 3: Create Your Gemini Website
Now, let's create a simple Gemini website.

1. Create an `index.gmi` file in your project directory. This will be the homepage of your website.
   ```gmi
   # Welcome to My Gemini Website

   Hello, world! This is my first Gemini website.
   ```

2. Create a Python script to serve your Gemini website. Let's name it `server.py`.
   ```python
   from twisted.internet import reactor
   from txgemini.server import GeminiServer

   server = GeminiServer()

   @server.route("/")
   def index():
       return open("index.gmi").read()

   reactor.listenTCP(1965, server)
   reactor.run()
   ```

### Step 4: Run Your Gemini Server
You're now ready to launch your Gemini server.

```bash
python server.py
```

### Step 5: Testing Your Gemini Website
Open your Gemini client (e.g., Lagrange, Kristall), and navigate to `gemini://localhost` to view your website.

### Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully built and served your first Gemini website using the Gemini API. From here, you can expand your website by adding more pages, styling with CSS, and exploring additional features of the Gemini protocol.
