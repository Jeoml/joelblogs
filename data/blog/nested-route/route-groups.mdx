## What are Route Groups?

Route Groups are a powerful feature in Next.js that allows you to organize your application's pages and 
apply different layouts to specific sections. This helps you maintain a clean and modular codebase, especially for larger projects.

## 1. Creating Route Groups

Imagine folders in your project directory. Route Groups are created by placing related pages 
inside a folder whose name is enclosed in parentheses (). For example:
```
app
  about
    page.js
  (marketing)  // This is a Route Group
    blog
      page.js
    contact
      page.js
  (dashboard)  // Another Route Group
    settings
      page.js
    profile
      page.js
```

Here, we have three groups: about, marketing, and dashboard

## 2. Applying Layouts to Route Groups

Within each Route Group, you can define a layout.js file. This file specifies the layout that will be applied to all pages within that group.

```
app
  about
    page.js
  (marketing)
    layout.js  // Defines layout for blog and contact
    blog
      page.js
    contact
      page.js
  (dashboard)
    layout.js  // Defines layout for settings and profile
    settings
      page.js
    profile
      page.js
```

## 3. Using Layouts

Inside `layout.js`, you can define a React component that wraps around the `children` prop. 
This prop will contain the content of the individual pages in the group.

```
// app/(marketing)/layout.js
import React from 'react';

const MarketingLayout = ({ children }) => (
  <div className="marketing-layout">
    <header>Marketing Header</header>
    <main>{children}</main>
    <footer>Marketing Footer</footer>
  </div>
);

export default MarketingLayout;
```
