## What is Gatsby?

Gatsby is an open-source framework built on top of React and Node.js that 
simplifies the process of creating modern websites and web applications.
It pre-renders your website for speed, security, and scalability, while 
still allowing for dynamic elements.

## Installing Gatsby

Gatsby can be installed in your computer by running the following 
code in the Windows Powershell (run as administrator)
`npm install -g gatsby-cli`
(-g here stands for global installation)

Upon doing that you might get this output
```
PS C:\Windows\system32> npm install -g gatsby-cli
changed 318 packages in 5s
63 packages are looking for funding
run `npm fund for details
```

After this, enter `gatsby --version` to verify whether gatsby CLI has been installed on your computer or not.

Upon doing that you might get this output
```
PS C:\Windows\system32> gatsby --version
Gatsby collects anonymous usage analytics

Gatsby CLI version: 5.13.3
```
However, there might be a case that you might be getting this result instead of the above one
```
PS C:\Windows\system32> gatsby --version
gatsby File C:\Users\joel1\AppData\Roaming\npm\gatsby.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system. For more information, see about_Execution_Policies at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. At line:1 char:1
+gatsby --version
+ CategoryInfo
: SecurityError: (:) [], PSSecurityException
+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess
```
In that case, follow these steps in the powershell:
    1. Enter `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser` in the powershell.
    2. On entering that you will be prompted to confirm the change. Type Y and press Enter.
    3. To verify the change enter `Get-ExecutionPolicy -List`.

The above changes should ensure that gatsby CLI is ready to run on your PC. 

Enter `gatsby --version` to verify the installation.
